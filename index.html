        <!--Enter About Me information here.-->
        <p>I am a professional seeking to enter the web-development industry.  I have spent many years in various rolls within the Hospitality industry and am looking for a change.
            Many of my project experiences for the hotel company I have worked for have developed my interest in web-development. These projects include being the property champion to set-up and roll out 3 different softwares for the property,
            becoming the property SME for my property with the Event Planning Database software, and learing, updating, and creating a user-friendly, users' manual for the company's
            code based reservations system. My success with these various projects drove my desire to expand my knowledge base with various classes and now, the UNCC Coding Bootcamp.
